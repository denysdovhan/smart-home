# Resources

On this page, I'm trying to collect useful resources I used to improve my home:

## Configurations

- [MacBury Smart House](https://macbury.github.io/SmartHouse) very cool and complex setup. I was inspired a lot by this.

## Articles and Guides

- [Consistent and well planned paths](https://wiki.servarr.com/docker-guide#consistent-and-well-planned-paths) in Sonarr and Radarr
- [TRaSH-Guides](https://trash-guides.info/) for properly configuring Sonarr, Radarr, Plex, etc
- [Hardlinks and Instant Moves (Atomic-Moves)](https://trash-guides.info/Hardlinks/Hardlinks-and-Instant-Moves/) by TRaSH Guides

## YouTube Channels

- [JuanMTech YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR7Xa7cU9wfkSY9v3yN2Vtw) about general Home Assistant setup. Very high-quality videos.
- [Zack Barett YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXpteV7qpsWi9uUkOeLAhaA) mostly about Lovelace UI configuration and new Home Assistant features.
- [DrZzs YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7G4tLa4Kt6A9e3hJ-HO8ng) about almost every possible smart-home related stuff. His hovering talking head might look a bit weird and even creepy, but the content itself is very useful.
- [Grayson Adams](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOvOYHQOgKg5m0uGmbweZBw) about devices overview, basic Home Assistant setup.
- [DB Tech](https://www.youtube.com/c/DBTechYT) generally about server administration. Mostly about Docker, Portainer, self-hosted services, OpenMediaVault, and Raspberry Pi. Very high-quality videos.
- [Home Automation Guy](https://www.youtube.com/@HomeAutomationGuy) very friendly and encouraging videos about HA and smart-home devices.

## Misc

- [Proxmox VE Helper-Scripts](https://helper-scripts.com/) a collection of helpers for Proxmox.
